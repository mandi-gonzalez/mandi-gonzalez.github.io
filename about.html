<h3>About Me</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>
Welcome to my portfolio! From Carolina to California, I started out my career as a UX Designer for Blizzard Entertainment, a dream job come true, but later I found UX Research to be more of my passion. 
Why? I love listening to people and their stories, and how research can be so foundational to the creation of products that ultimately improves people's lives.
</p>

<p> After Blizzard, I traveled cross-country to Atlanta, GA to work as a UX Researcher at The Home Depot, where I worked on their core e-commerce shopping platform, where I led both strategic and tactical studies using mixed methods, such as usability testing, card sorting, interviewing, survey design and more, where the compelling insights drive the strategy/design for valuable people-centered experiences. Then Mayvenn came along and I become their first UX Researcher to join the team.
I've always been lucky enough to work with an incredibly passionate and talented, cross-functional, and multidisciplinary team of engineers, designers, researchers, project managers, various stakeholders, and more.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, Iâ€™m a former band geek who loves all kinds of music, all kinds of video games (Candy Crush, Solitaire, Overwatch, Skyrim), hiking, sightseeing, and eating lots of great food (and chicken nuggets) from around the world. I love cats as well, but who doesn't? </p>
