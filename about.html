					<h3>  <span class="image left"><img src="images/me2.png" alt="mandi's headshot" /></span> Hi there and welcome to my UXR portfolio site! </h3> 
					My professional journey in UX started at Blizzard Entertainment, 
					where I worked a hybrid UX designer in their enterprise apps department, doing both research and design work for the product team.
					It was a dream job come true! After 3 wonderful years there, 
					my reflection on my Blizzard experience taught me that research was where I wanted my career focus to be instead of design.
					<p><i>Research is where my passion lies due to my love for listening to people and their stories, 
					and how research can be so foundational to the creation of products that ultimately improves people's lives.</i>
					</p></p>
					<p>
					Once my time at Blizzard reached an end, I traveled cross-country from California to Atlanta, GA to work as a UX Researcher at The Home Depot, 
					where I worked on their core e-commerce shopping platform, leading both strategic and tactical studies using mixed methods, 
					such as usability testing, card sorting, interviewing, survey design and more. 
					I crafted compelling insights that drove the strategy/design for valuable people-centered experiences. 
					Then an e-commerce startup named Mayvenn Hair came along and I become their first UX Researcher 
					to join the team and create a solid foundational practice there. 
					I've always been lucky enough to work with an incredibly passionate and talented people, 
					working in cross-functional and multidisciplinary teams of engineers, designers, researchers, project managers, various stakeholders, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
					Outside of my professional life, Iâ€™m a former band geek who loves all kinds of music, 
					all kinds of video games (Candy Crush, Solitaire, Overwatch, Skyrim), hiking, sightseeing, and eating lots of great food (and chicken nuggets) from around the world. 
					I love cats as well, but who doesn't?
					</p>
