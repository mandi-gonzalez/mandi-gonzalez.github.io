<h3>About Me</h3>
&nbsp;

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated and curious by the human experience, where growing up introverted and inquisitive helped me foster myself where I am today as a researcher, with a focus on how technology can improve people's lives for the better. </p>

<p>As a UX Researcher, you can find me leading both strategic and tactical studies using mixed methods, such as usability testing, card sorting, interviewing, survey design and more, where the insights help inform the design for valuable experiences that are user-centered. 
	As a former UX Designer, I can empathise with the designers to another level most researchers can't, and I understand the UX process as a whole at a much deeper level.
	One of the best parts about working in tech is the people - I've worked with incredibly passionate and talented people over the years, currently at The Home Depot working with a great cross-functional multidisciplinary team of engineers, designers, researchers, project managers, various stakeholders, and more.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional life, I&rsquo;m a former band geek who loves all kinds of music, video games (think Candy Crush, Solitaire, Overwatch. Skyrim, etc), hiking, sightseeing, and eating lots of great food from around the world. </p>
