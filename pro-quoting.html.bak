 									<h3>Project Overview</h3>

										<p> 
										The Home Depot offers their Pro customers the opportunity to request a quote for their work orders, 
										but much about the current experience was unknown. This research project I led end-to-end aimed to better understand 
										and discover what that current experience looked like for Pros and how they felt when getting quotes with The Home Depot, 
										in store or online. I conducted both a survey and remote 1:1 interviews to better understand our Pros in this quoting context, 
										using tools such as UserTesting and our own internal panel called Home Depot Doers to facilitate the recruitment process. 
										</p>
										<p> The results helped the team how to approach an improved online experience of submitting quotes, 
										along with creating more research study opportunities to pursue for the team.

							<h3>Context</h3>

							<p>  The Home Depot, the nations’ largest home improvement retailer, serves 3 types of customers: 
							Do-It-Yourself (DIY), Do-It-For-Me (DIFM), and Pros (think handy-people, contractors, house flippers, etc).
								Pros make up ~70% of sales for the company, but only ~30% of the total customer base, 
								so the company invests a lot into the online Pro experience. 
								One of those experiences Home Depot offers includes offering Pros the opportunity to request quotes for their job needs.
								A quote is a estimated price, usually discounted, that Home Depot offers for a list of items that Pros need to purchase, 
								usually large in price and/or quantity.

						<h3> The Problem </h3>
						
						<p>
						 Teams across The Home Depot began ramping up on quote related projects online, 
						 but there were significant gaps in knowledge of what Pro quoting looks like to begin with. 
						 To assist Home Depot in supporting our Pro customers with their quoting needs, 
						 we needed to understand how they were currently experiencing getting quotes from the business.

						</p>
							
							 
						
						<h3>Research Objective</h3>
								<p>
								The research objective then became to <b>
								understand the current experience of how Pros go about getting 
								and finalized quotes for their projects from the Home Depot 
								and how their experience with in-store associates facilitates this process. </b>

								<h4>Study Questions</h4>
								<ol>
								<li>What is the communication like between Pros and Home Depot associates throughout the end-to-end quotes journey? </li>
								<li>What is the experience like to track and send information during this journey?</li>
								<li>Why do Pros create a quote online vs in-store?</li>
								</ol>

								In addition to this study, another researcher conducted a separate but related study around 
								understanding the holistic journey of quoting (agnostic of the company). 

								</p>		
								
								
								
						<h3>Study Design</h3>
								<h4>Methodology </h4>
								<ul> <li> 1 hour remote Interviews (n=7) </li>
								<li> 15 question survey (n=213) </li>
								</ul>
								

								<h4>Rationale: </h4>
								<p>
								Interviews gave us a sense of what Pros think and feel about the Home Depot's 
								quoting experience and what tools and communication processes they use. 
								The survey gives us quantitative insights around how and where Pros are achieving their quoting needs.

 						<h3> Target Audience </h3>

											<p>We talked 7 Pros in the interview and recived 213 responses from the survey, 
											where we screened for Pros who:
												<ul>
													<li> recently got a quote from The Home Depot within 3 months</li>
													<li> are Renovator/Remodelers</li>
													<li> are Property Investors</li>
												</ul>
												I recruited Pros from the research team's own internal panel platform to
												do schedule Pros for interviews and capture survey responses using the same platform (FlexMR).
												
											</p>
									 
 								<br>
								
								<h3> Sample Questions </h3>

									<h4> Interview Questions </h4>
										<ul>
										<li> When it comes specifically to quotes and quoting—who typically is involved with that in your organization? </li> 
										<li> Overall, what’s your experience been like getting quotes with The Home Depot? </li> 
										<li> Can you walk me through what it’s like to go through the quoting process with The Home Depot? </li> 
										<li> What is the experience like sending over your list of materials?</li> 
										</ul>

									<h4> Survey Questions </h4>
										<ul> 
										<li>How do you create your quotes with The Home Depot?</li> 
										<li>When starting the quoting process online, what format is your list of materials in when you share it with the Pro Desk? </li> 
										</ul>
								
								<br>								
							<h3> Analysis </h3>

								<p>
								To analyze and synthesize the collected data, I used the collaboration whiteboarding tool Miro to transform the data into sticky notes that 
								I grouped into meaningful themes (affinity mapping exercise).
								</p>		 

 						
								<br>
								

								<h3> Insights & Recommendations </h3>
								<p>Here is a snapshot of what the executive summary of insights looked like when I presented the report to stakeholders:</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pro-quoting/insights.png" alt="" /></span>
							
								<p> With the insights in tow, I was able to make the following <b> Recommendations </b> for the team: <p>
								<ol>
								<li> Support the experience of allowing Pros to start and finish the quoting process where they
								please, for example, start the quoting process online and finish it in-store, even supporting it
								earlier in their project lifecycle. </li>
								<li> Understand the full extent of what the barriers are to Pros using THD’s online lists, particularly in the
								context of quotes, so we can help Pros use lists to their advantage for quotes. </li>
								<li> Ensure how to make the current and future state of the online quoting tool salient to Pros. </li>
								</ol>

								<h3> Impact </h3>
								<ul>
								<li>The Enterprise team scheduled a workshop within a
									week of the readout to kickoff opportunities.
								<li>The team prioritized getting the online quoting
									capability to appear earlier in a Pro customer’s
									shopping journey. </li>
								<li> Research further studied how Pros understand the
									relationship between lists and quotes and cart
									experiences. </li>
								<li>Currently in development is a new feature that will help
									Pros send a list or quote (that they began online) to
									a store associate.</li>

								<h3> Reflection </h3>
								<!--<span class="image fit"><img src="images/videos-banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>-->
							
								<h4> What could have gone better? </h4>
								
								<ul>
								

									<li> Our recruitment pool consisted of mostly small Pros, so I didn’t speak with Pros 
									who worked with assigned PARs (white glove service associates) nor design consultants </li>
									<li>Lots of Pros did not show up (50%), so I decided to
									scheduled more Pros than needed just in case.
									</li>
											
							
									</ul>
									<h4> Positives </h4>
								 
									<ul>
									<li>
									I was able to collaborate with another researcher on this particular study, 
									which was a first and a great positive learning experience from a Senior Researcber
									</li>
									<li>I got to work in the Pro domain with stakeholders I don't usually work with
									</li>
									<li>And lastly, I was able to make strategic impact on a larger scale.
									</li>
