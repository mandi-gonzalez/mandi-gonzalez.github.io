 									<h3>Project Overview</h3>

										<p> 
										Mayvenn Hair, Inc. is an online e-commerce site that specializes in selling hair to customers, such as hair bundles, wigs, and more.
										At the time, the company only had assumptions and anecdotal data about who their customers were, 
										with no UX customer personas that existed. My research study filled this gap,
										where I conducted 12 remote interviews with Mayvenn customers to help develop three (3) personas for the business. 
									
										</p>
										<p> The impact of the personas resulted in the personas being constantly asked for by VPs for reference, 
										also referenced by incoming UX designers in their design work, helped impact decision making around the company 
										in terms of releasing more color options for hair, 
										and look at considering releasing shorter looks (for older, career-upwards women).

							<h3>Context + Problem </h3>

							<p> Mayvenn Hair, Inc. is a e-commerce startup based in California that
								sells hair online such as wigs, bundles, and more. They
								also connect customers to stylists in their area to help
								install hair.
							</p>
							<p>
							Mayvenn had assumptions about who their customers
							were but had no evidence or documentation such as
							customer personas to help understand their customer
							base better and satisfy their needs.
</p>

						<br>	 
					
						<h3>Research Objective</h3>
								<p>
								The research objective then became to <b>
								help the business understand who are Mayvenn’s customers </b> with the 
								intention of having customer personas as the deliverable of this research.
								</p>

						<h3>Study Design</h3>
								<h4>Methodology </h4>
								<p>1-hour remote Interviews (n=15) </p>
								 		

								<h4>Rationale: </h4>
								<p>
								Interviews would give us the ability to ask questions
								about our customers in an unstructured format, giving us leeway into what questions we could ask.
								</p>

 						<h3> Target Audience </h3>
					
											<p>We interviewed 15 Mayvenn customers where we screened for customers those who:
												<ul>
													<li> were planning on shopping for hair online in the next 3 months</li>
													<li> who have shopped at Mayvenn in the last 6 months </li>
													
												</ul>
												I recruited our customers from our internal database via
												the company's <b>Google Looker</b> cloud database software, used
												the <b>Typeform</b> platform to create a screen survey, partnered with the
												internal email marketing team to send a recruitment email, and
												used <b>Calendly</b> to schedule the interviews. Lots of tools were used, as you can see!
												
											</p>
									 
 								<br>
								
								<h3> Sample Interview Questions </h3>

										<ul>
										<li> What kind of hair are you typically shopping for?  </li> 
										<li> Where are you typically shopping for hair at? </li> 
										<li> Why do you shop for the hair that you do? </li> 
										<li> Overall, what’s your experience been like getting hair with Mayvenn?</li> 
										<li> What is your experience like with your stylist? </li>
										<li> How do you maintain your hair? </li>
										</ul>
							
							<br>
							
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
							<h3> Analysis </h3>
								<p>
								To analyze and synthesize the collected data, I used the collaboration whiteboarding tool <b>Miro</b> to transform the data into sticky notes that 
								I grouped into meaningful themes (affinity mapping exercise).
								</p>	
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/personas/affinity.png" alt="" />
								<figcaption> Sticky notes from the affinity mappping exericse before it officially started.</figcaption>
								</span>
							</div>
							</div>
								
								 

								
								<br>
								

								<h3> Personas </h3>
								<p>There were the customers personas I created using Figma, where we essentially found 3 archetypes: </p>
							
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/personas/persona1.png" alt="Switchable Simone Persona" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
								<p> <b> Switchable Simone </b> tends to switch up her looks often, who enjoys experimenting with different colors
									and styles, so she can transform her look and feel beautiful doing so.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/personas/persona2.png" alt="Occasional Olivia Persona" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
								<p> <b> Occasional Olivia </b> typically is only getting her hair done for special occasions.
								She is not buying hair as often as the other personas, but she does need hair that will make her look beautiful for the occasion and she is willing
								to pay a pretty penny for it.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
								<div class="row">
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/personas/persona3.png" alt="Everyday Evelyn persona" /></span>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobilep">
								<p><b> Everyday Evelyn </b> is a woman who has been getting her hair done for 15+ years and because of her alopecia, she
									resorts to wearing wigs. Because she is a working woman, she typically needs styles that look like her own hair and that it looks real.</p>
								</div>
								</div>
			
								<br>
														 
								<h3> Impact </h3>
								<p> The study was asked for by VPs, referenced by incoming UX designers in their design work, helped
									impact decision making around the company in terms of releasing more color options for hair, and look at
									considering releasing shorter looks (for older, career-upwards women.
								</p>
								<p> The next steps were to create a survey to help generalize the findings, but shifting research priorities
									caused this second phase to be pushed back in the research backlog. 
								</p>
																		
							
								<h3> Reflection </h3>
									<h4> What could have gone better? </h4>
										<ul>
											<li> I could have encouraged better participation rates of stakeholders to join in and observe the sessions,
												including participating in the affinity mapping exercise of looking at the data.
											</li>
											<li>The amount of tools (10) to recruit, book, and remind customers was a lot on my plate – it made me realize
												we needed a better platform to run research end-to-end.
											</li>
										</ul>
									
									<h4> Positives </h4>
								 
									<p>
									Being able to deliver a much-needed research artifact for the business to use in the long term was a great
									feeling to have, especially as someone who was the first and only UX researcher at the company. This was great
									foundational work that would impact the company in many ways for the near future.
									</p>
