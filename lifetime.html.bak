 									<h3>Project Overview</h3>

										<p> 
										UNC’s Lifetime Library is a website and desktop application designed to provide students and alums with access to “grid data storage”, 
										otherwise known as “cloud storage” for their entire lives.
										</p>
										<p>I was an undergrad taking a course called “Usability Testing & Evaluation”, working with graduate students, where we were able to choose this system for this usability project. 
										We created a usability test and had participants use the system. 
										Our results indicated the system needed much more work to be done and we subsequently provided a set of recommendations that could improve the system.
										</p>
										
										<p> For this project, my role was user research, where I was moderating and contributing to test plans for usability tests. 
										My team members that I worked with on this project were Michael Head, Mrudula Sudarsanam, and Erin Holmes.

							<h3> The Process </h3>
							
							<ol>
							<li> First, we decided on the appropriate <b>user profile</b> to understand what kind of use cases we would test participants on. 
							<li> We also did a <b>cognitive walkthrough</b> of the site in order to come up with appropriate tasks for the usability test.
							<li> We then established the <b>goal</b> of the usability test, how we were going to <b>collect</b> the data
							and how we were going to <b>evaluate</b> that data. </li>
							<li> We then tested 4 participants with 4 tasks at UNC SILS special <b>testing lab</b> in a week's time. </li>
							<li> The last step was finally putting together a <b>report</b> of findings and recommendations that we delivered to the client.</li>

							<h3> Evaluation Metrics </h3>
								
								<h4> Task Performance </h4>
								<p>
								Task success was analyzed to evaluate task performance. 
								A post-task questionnaire question asked users how confident they were they completed the previous task. 
								System errors were counted to determine if users were able to avoid errors.
								</p>	
							 
								
								<h4> Perceived Use of Time </h4>
								<p>
								A post-task questionnaire question asked users if they felt the time spent on the previous task was 
								less, more, or about what they expected.


								</p>
								
								<h4> Comparative Ease of Use </h4>
								<p>
								Each post-task questionnaire contained a matrix asking users to compare the task to a similar task in systems they were familiar with.
								</p>
								
								<h4> Perceived Ease of Use </h4>
								<p>
								Each post-task questionnaire asked users to rate the level of difficulty of the previous task.
								</p>
							 
								
							<h3> Results </h3>
								<p>
								Participants were mostly successful in performing all tasks we asked them to perform, with the exception of Sharing a File. 
								However, participants were quite confident they completed the Sharing a File task. 
								We hypothesize this is because of the way sharing works in the Lifetime Library. We asked participants to let another user view a file, 
								but another user would not be able to view the file because the Lifetime Library does not support sharing just a file. 
								<b>While the Lifetime Library does not prevent users from performing fundamental tasks (aside from sharing a file), 
								participants perceived it as not being easy to use.</b>
								</p>
								
							<h3> Reflection </h3>
								<p>
								This was my first time doing a usability test, so I learned many things from it, 
								from understanding the value of planning such tests to understanding 
								when it was appropriate to interrupt users to learn more about a particular action they took during the completion of a task. 
								It was a course that I really owe a lot to due it jumpstarting my interest in user experience.
